The "Assess Project" button opens a window that is titled with "Project Creation Result" this does not make sense here.

There is no way to tell what project was reviewed after clicking the "Assess Project" button.

I should have the ability to have a guided prompt for the existing project that is Assessed. There should be the ability to have a guided prompt, based off the review of the project.
The prompt will have industsry leading questions to help get an understanding of what the user wants to do with the existing project.
Based off the existing project that was reviewed, and the questions from the prompt, the application will then utilize the standards established in the project to develop documentation that should be established in the applicaton
already as it is what would be used for a new project too.  However, with an exisitng project it would be based off the exisitng project.
