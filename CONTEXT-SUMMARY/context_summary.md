# ProjectPlanner Documentation Consolidation Context Summary

## Session Overview
**Goal:** Consolidate all documentation into a single organized Documentation folder for efficient access and maintenance.
**Context:** Documentation was previously scattered across multiple folders, making it hard to find and maintain. This reorganization brings all guides, standards, templates, and onboarding docs into a unified structure.
**Status:** Documentation files moved and organized. Internal links updated. Review and validation completed.

## Previous Context
- Documentation was distributed in: agentsPart2, do next, docs, DOCS-EXISTING-PROJECTS, DOCS-NEW-PROJECTS, FeatureSet3, GUI, MajorPhase2, phas2, PLANNING, STANDARDS.
- No unified documentation folder existed.

## Current Work: Documentation Reorganization

### Implementation Plan
- [x] Create Documentation folder and subfolders by topic
- [x] Move all documentation files into Documentation/
- [x] Update internal links in markdown files
- [x] Validate accessibility and correctness
