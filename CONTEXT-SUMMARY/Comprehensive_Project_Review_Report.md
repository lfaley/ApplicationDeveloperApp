# Comprehensive Project Review Report

**Date:** 2025-11-24

## Overview
This document summarizes the findings of a comprehensive review of the project, including code quality, test coverage, documentation, security, dependencies, and configuration.

---

## 1. Code Quality & Structure
- Major components follow clear modular structure (frontend, backend agents, workflow logic).
- TypeScript and JavaScript code use modern patterns and best practices.
- Classes and functions are well-organized and documented.

## 2. Test Coverage & Quality
- Test files exist for core modules, agents, and storage logic.
- Tests cover unit, integration, and orchestration patterns.
- Test structure, naming, and setup/teardown follow best practices.
- No direct evidence of automated coverage reporting; recommend enabling coverage output for tracking.

## 3. Documentation
- Extensive documentation is present: root README, per-folder READMEs, architecture, API, integration, and testing standards.
- Documentation is up to date, versioned, and includes quick start guides and improvement roadmaps.

## 4. Security, Dependency, and Configuration
- All production dependencies audited: **0 vulnerabilities found** (npm audit, as of 2025-11-24).
- Modern dependency versions in use; lockfiles present for reproducible builds.
- Recommend regular audits and lockfile updates for ongoing security.
