## 📝 Plan Steps
- ✅ **Review all files in CONTEXT-SUMMARY**
- 🔄 **Review all documentation files in the following folders: agentsPart2, do next, DOCS-EXISTING-PROJECTS, DOCS-NEW-PROJECTS, FeatureSet3, GUI (markdown only), MajorPhase2, MCP-SERVER (markdown only), phase2, PLANNING, STANDARDS**
-  **Move all documentation files from the above folders into the Documentation folder, preserving subfolder structure as needed**
-  **Organize the moved documentation in the Documentation folder into a logical structure (by topic, phase, or type)**
-  **Create a master index/README in Documentation summarizing the structure and contents**
-  **Remove any empty or placeholder ".keep" files from Documentation**
-  **Validate that all documentation is present, organized, and accessible from the master index**
-  **Summarize the process and any issues encountered in a report file in Documentation**
