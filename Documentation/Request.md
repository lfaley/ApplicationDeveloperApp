you didnt move any of the documentation to the doumentation folder.  
please try again.  you created files called "keep" that are blank. 
this is not at all what i requested.  
First i need you to review all files in the folder "CONTEXT-SUMMARY".
Then I asked you to move everything in the folders i listed, to the documenation folder.  
then i asked you to review them and organize them in a logical way.  
the folders again are:

agentsPart2

do next

DOCS-EXISTING-PROJECTS

DOCS-NEW-PROJECTS

FeatureSet3

The markdown files in the folder "GUI"

MajorPhase2

The markdown files in the folder "MCP-SERVER"
